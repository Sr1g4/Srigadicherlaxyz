# Welcome to my blog

This is where I unpack what I’m paying attention to in **today’s tech news**—and connect it to the things I’m actively building, testing, and learning across **cloud**, **AI systems**, and **software engineering**.

I’m especially interested in:
- **AI systems in production** (latency, reliability, evaluation, cost)
- **Cloud architecture** (scaling, observability, security, IaC)
- **Developer tooling** (agents, automation, and workflow design)
- **Research → practice** (papers worth reading, and what actually works when implemented)

Most posts fall into two styles:
1. **News-to-engineering**: a headline or trend → what it means technically → what I’d do about it.
2. **Build notes**: deeper write-ups from projects—design decisions, tradeoffs, diagrams, and learnings.

Posts are written in **Markdown/MDX**, so I can include code, diagrams, and structured sections easily.  
New posts are just new `.mdx` files in `content/blog/`—publish by committing and deploying.

If you’re into practical AI + cloud engineering (with receipts), you’ll feel at home here.
