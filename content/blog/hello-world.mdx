# Welcome to my blog

This is where I unpack what I’m paying attention to in **today’s tech news** and connect it to the things I’m actively building, testing, and learning across **cloud**, **AI systems**, and **software engineering**.

I’m especially interested in:
- **AI systems in production** (latency, reliability, evaluation, cost)
- **Cloud architecture** (scaling, observability, security, IaC)
- **Developer tooling** (agents, automation, and workflow design)
- **Research → practice** (papers worth reading, and what actually works when implemented)
