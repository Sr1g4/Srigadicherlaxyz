Being at the pinnacle of the AI movement, many look at ChatGPT and Claude as the two dominant players in the LLM and AI market. But is that reputation just mainstream visibility—or do they actually outperform every other model in the world? I wanted to find out for myself, so I went into research mode, leaning on the work of AI and ML researchers [Nathan Lambert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natolambert/) (Interconnects) and [Kai Williams](https://www.understandingai.org/p/the-best-chinese-open-weight-models) (Understanding AI). What I found reshaped how I see the open-model landscape.

## Introduction

By early 2026, the landscape of open-weight large language models (LLMs) has shifted dramatically. Chinese-developed models now lead in both usage and capability, overturning the Western dominance of earlier years. In fact, data from Hugging Face downloads – a common (if noisy) proxy for model adoption – shows that the top three most-used open LLM families are: (1) Alibaba's Qwen, (2) Meta's Llama, and (3) OpenAI's GPT-OSS.

This finding has surprised many observers, since it means two of the top three open model ecosystems originate from China. Even so, some industry watchers have been slow to accept this reality, given that Western projects initially led the open-source LLM boom. The dominance of Qwen (and the enduring popularity of Llama) underscores how quickly the open LLM balance of power has shifted eastward – and how ecosystem inertia and community adoption can keep older models like Llama relevant long after their last official update. Equally telling is the stratification in the "big model" category (generally models with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters).

Here, a Chinese project called DeepSeek has established a clear lead, outpacing even OpenAI's GPT-OSS and Qwen's largest offerings in usage at the very high end. In other words, for truly large open models, DeepSeek stands out as the most adopted, while GPT-OSS and Qwen trail behind alongside other contenders. This niche leadership by DeepSeek, contrasted with Qwen's broad dominance overall, highlights how different segments of the open-model ecosystem have distinct champions. This report provides a comprehensive overview of these trends. We will examine each of the top open LLM families – Qwen, Llama, and GPT-OSS – and delve into the key factors behind their popularity. We'll also explore the unique position of DeepSeek in the large-model segment, discuss key performance indicators (KPIs) such as model downloads and benchmark scores, and present real-world examples and visualizations to illustrate how these models are being used in practice. The goal is to paint a picture of why Qwen, Llama, and GPT-OSS have risen to the top of open-source adoption by 2026, and what this tells us about the state of the AI ecosystem.

## Qwen: The Ascendant Open Model Family

Qwen (a suite of models developed by Alibaba) has rapidly become the world's most widely used open LLM family. In 2025, Qwen effectively unseated Meta's Llama as the default choice for many open AI applications. The Qwen series offers models at a wide range of scales – from tiny 600-million parameter assistants up to multi-billion parameter versions – and excels in providing strong performance even at smaller sizes. This flexibility (high-quality models that can run on modest hardware) has been a major factor in Qwen's broad adoption across the AI community. In fact, an analysis by the [ATOM project](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/atom-project) confirms that Qwen now accounts for more downloads than any other model family globally, underscoring its immense popularity.

Several Qwen models dominate the leaderboards in terms of downloads. For example, among models released since August 2025, Qwen variants occupy 7 of the top 10 spots by download count. These include instruct-tuned models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (a 7B parameter model with 52.4 million downloads) and multimodal versions like Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (a 3B vision-language model with 49.5M downloads). Such models serve a variety of use cases – from general conversational agents to visual understanding – and their presence at the top of the charts reflects how Qwen has become a go-to foundation for both developers and researchers. Notably, Qwen's success isn't limited to one flagship model; it's a whole family hitting critical mass. A handful of Qwen's recent releases even outperform entire groups of competitors: in December 2025, the five most-downloaded Qwen3 models (of various sizes) had more combined downloads than all models from OpenAI, Mistral, Nvidia, Z.AI, Moonshot, and MiniMax put together. This staggering lead speaks to the network effects Qwen has achieved – once a model family becomes widely adopted, each new variant gains a ready audience and integration into existing pipelines.

Why is Qwen so dominant? One reason is that Chinese open models have been leading on raw capabilities, which attracts users. Over the past year, Chinese research groups have consistently produced the "smartest" open models on most benchmarks. Qwen models in particular are top performers across many tasks, meaning users don't have to sacrifice quality when opting for an open solution. For example, Qwen's largest openly released models (up to ~80B parameters in the Qwen3 series) score at or near state-of-the-art on reasoning benchmarks, closing the gap with some proprietary models. Another factor is practicality and community support: Alibaba's team has optimized Qwen models for real-world use (including instruction tuning and tool-use abilities), and they release them under a permissive open license, which encourages adoption. There's also a robust open-source community around Qwen – numerous fine-tunes and derivatives have been built on Qwen bases. By late 2025, Qwen had the largest share of derivative models on Hugging Face (counting meaningful fine-tuned variants), reflecting that many developers choose Qwen as the starting point for their own models. All these factors reinforce a virtuous cycle: strong performance leads to high adoption, which leads to community investment (more fine-tunes, better tooling), further solidifying Qwen as the default choice.

It's worth noting that Qwen's dominance is most pronounced at small-to-medium model scales, where its nearest Western rivals have struggled to compete. From roughly 1B up to 30B parameters, Qwen models see unparalleled popularity. However, at the very high end (100B+), Qwen historically had a gap – its largest model (the 235B "Qwen3-Max") was not released openly. This created an opening for another player, DeepSeek, to shine in the large-model niche (discussed more below). But across the board, Qwen's prevalence is clear. As one industry expert succinctly noted, "Qwen alone is roughly matching the entire American open model ecosystem today". It's a striking statement about how far a single well-executed model family can go in tilting the balance of the open AI world.

## Llama: Ecosystem Inertia and Ongoing Influence

Meta's Llama family, though now overtaken in many respects by Qwen, remains a cornerstone of the open model ecosystem. Llama's inertia – the lasting momentum from its early popularity – demonstrates how an established open-source model can continue to thrive due to community support and integration, even without official updates. As of late 2025, Llama models (notably Llama 2 and early Llama 3 variants) were "still by far the most downloaded Western models" each month. In fact, the single most downloaded model on Hugging Face from August 2025 onward was a Llama variant: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct topped the charts with 53.3M downloads. This is remarkable considering that Meta itself had largely stepped back from actively promoting new Llama versions after releasing Llama 3. Despite the lack of continued support from Meta, Llama remains deeply entrenched in the open-source AI community.

Several factors explain Llama's enduring presence. First is the extensive ecosystem built around Llama since its debut. Llama 2 (released in mid-2023) was one of the first high-quality open-weight model families, and it spawned countless fine-tuned models (Alpacas, Vicunas, etc.), developer tools, and research projects. That momentum carried into Llama 3, which Meta released in 2024 with even larger variants (up to 70B and 405B parameters). By the time Qwen and others arrived, Llama already had a rich ecosystem of libraries and user familiarity. Many companies and hobbyists had incorporated Llama-based models into their workflows, and switching out of that stack can be non-trivial. In other words, developer familiarity and community investment give Llama a long tail of relevance. One commentator observed that Llama's continued popularity "emphasizes the value of ecosystem support and developer familiarity" – even when flashier new models appear, people stick with what's already working for them.

Secondly, Llama's open licensing and accessibility set a standard that others followed. Meta's decision to open-source Llama (starting with Llama 2 under a relatively permissive license) catalyzed the entire open LLM field. It enabled a generation of researchers to experiment freely. The trust and goodwill built by that move means Llama is often the baseline against which new open models are compared. For example, when organizations evaluate a new model like Qwen or GPT-OSS, they typically test it against a Llama benchmark or a Llama-based solution they already have. If the new model isn't dramatically better, there's inertia to just keep using Llama. And in cases where Western organizations have concerns about using Chinese models (due to compliance or branding issues), Llama (or its fine-tunes) can appear as a "safer" default choice. This was hinted at by anecdotes in industry: e.g. some U.S. companies hesitated to adopt Qwen or DeepSeek due to origin, sticking with Western models despite the quality gap.

Finally, it's important to note that Llama is not static – the community has effectively taken over its evolution. Even if Meta isn't updating the weights frequently, independent projects continue to improve instruction tuning, add tools, and optimize Llama for specific domains. For instance, multiple entries in the top 50 models are Llama-derived instruct versions or specialized variants (including those by Meta and even third parties like Nvidia's Nemotron finetune). These indicate that Llama's core architecture is still being leveraged and refined. All this contributes to a scenario where Llama acts as a stable backbone of the open-model world. Its "inertia" is less about stagnation and more about the staying power of an open platform once it gains critical mass. As a result, even as newer families like Qwen have surged ahead in raw numbers, Llama remains the second most-used open model family overall – a testament to its foundational role in the ecosystem.

## GPT-OSS: OpenAI's Entry into Open-Source

The third major player in 2026's open LLM rankings is GPT-OSS, a line of models released by OpenAI. OpenAI surprised the industry in [August 2025](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss) by open-sourcing two high-performance models, GPT-OSS-20B and GPT-OSS-120B, under an Apache 2.0 license. This move – a notable departure for a company known for proprietary models – was motivated by a strategic recognition that open models have unique advantages in certain contexts (on-premises deployment, community-driven innovation, etc.). The GPT-OSS models were billed as "open-weight reasoning models" that deliver strong real-world performance at low cost. In practice, they lived up to that promise: GPT-OSS-120B pushed the frontier of open model capabilities, achieving near-equal with some of OpenAI's own internal models on key benchmarks while being able to run on a single high-end GPU. Meanwhile, the smaller GPT-OSS-20B was optimized for edge devices (running with just 16 GB of memory) and offered an attractive balance of power and efficiency for local deployments.

OpenAI entering the open-source arena was a significant validation of the open model approach. And adoption metrics suggest GPT-OSS quickly gained traction despite being a latecomer. By the end of 2025, OpenAI's two GPT-OSS models were already achieving monthly download counts comparable to the entire roster of DeepSeek's or Mistral's models. In the cumulative rankings since August '25, GPT-OSS-20B emerged as the 6th most-downloaded model overall (43.1M downloads), and GPT-OSS-120B was close behind at 11th (22.3M). This is a strong showing for just two models, indicating substantial interest from the community. Much of GPT-OSS's appeal lies in its pedigree and performance – these models leveraged OpenAI's advanced training techniques (reportedly informed by their cutting-edge proprietary models like GPT-4 variants) and thus outperformed other open models of similar size on reasoning tasks. Essentially, OpenAI provided a "best-in-class" open model that many developers had been waiting for. Evaluations found that GPT-OSS-120B nearly matched the top Chinese open models in evaluated intelligence; it "was close to retaking the lead" on certain benchmark indices (coming just shy of surpassing MiniMax's best model). This gave hope that Western open models could again compete at the cutting edge of quality, even if Qwen remained far ahead in usage.

Another factor driving GPT-OSS adoption is OpenAI's effort to integrate these models into real-world solutions. From the outset, OpenAI partnered with organizations like AI Sweden, Orange, and Snowflake to deploy GPT-OSS models in practical settings. These early partnerships validated GPT-OSS in applications such as on-premises data processing (for privacy/security) and fine-tuning on industry-specific datasets. The message was clear: GPT-OSS isn't just a research curiosity; it's meant for production use. Its strong performance on tasks like chain-of-thought reasoning and tool use (e.g. executing code or web search within prompts) made it especially attractive for building agentic AI workflows – a growing trend in enterprise AI where models handle complex sequences of actions. By offering open models with such capabilities, OpenAI filled a gap for companies that needed powerful LLMs but also wanted the flexibility and inspection that open weights provide. As a result, GPT-OSS rapidly rose to be the third pillar of the open LLM ecosystem. It doesn't (yet) rival Qwen or Llama in sheer number of community extensions or total downloads, but it has carved out a crucial space: a Western-developed open model family that companies can more readily trust and adopt, and that researchers can study freely, all while delivering top-tier performance.

## The Rise of Chinese Open Models and DeepSeek's Niche

Cumulative downloads of open-source LLMs by region (USA vs China vs EU), Jan 2023–Jan 2026. Chinese-developed models (red line) saw an explosion in adoption through 2025, overtaking US-based models (blue) by late 2025. This "flip" in download share reflects China's growing lead in open AI model development and usage.

The ascendance of Qwen and other Chinese models is part of a broader trend: China has taken a commanding lead in open-model adoption. As shown above, cumulative download counts for Chinese-origin LLMs surged ahead of those for US-based models around Q3 2025. Multiple Chinese tech firms and research labs have been actively releasing open models (e.g. Alibaba with Qwen, Baidu with others, startups like Zhipu's Ziya, MiniMax, KLCII, Moonshot AI's Kimi, etc.), but the lion's share of adoption falls to just a couple of giants. Qwen is the standout, with DeepSeek as a noteworthy second player. In contrast, the many smaller entrants from both China and the West have barely made a dent in global metrics – their contributions are almost "rounding errors" in comparison. For instance, highly publicized startups (like France's Mistral AI or China's Z.AI and MiniMax) did release impressive models in late 2025, but when we look at usage data, those models appear far down the ranks. DeepSeek is the exception among the newer names, having achieved significant adoption in a specific domain of the market.

So what is DeepSeek? DeepSeek is a Chinese AI lab (and product company) that gained fame with its "Reasoning" LLMs. It first shocked the AI world in January 2025 by releasing DeepSeek R1, a large model that introduced some novel capabilities. R1 was remarkable not just for its open release, but for its features – it was one of the first open models to show its full chain-of-thought reasoning to users (e.g. a chatbot that visibly "thinks out loud" before answering). This transparency and strong reasoning ability captured public attention: the DeepSeek R1-powered app briefly topped the iOS App Store charts, even surpassing ChatGPT in popularity for a time. That moment demonstrated the appetite for cutting-edge open models and proved that a relatively small player could momentarily outshine the incumbents by innovating on usability. R1's success also had strategic ripple effects – it spurred a "renaissance" of open-weight efforts by Chinese companies, who saw an opportunity to leap ahead of Western rivals. By late 2025, Alibaba's Qwen had capitalized on this trend to become #1, but DeepSeek had firmly established itself as #2 out of China.

Where DeepSeek particularly excels is in the realm of very large models. The lab followed up R1 with a series of models (often labeled by versions like V3, etc.) focused on the upper end of model size. According to ecosystem analyses, DeepSeek's large-scale models have achieved higher adoption than any other open models at similar scales. In fact, data shows a clear split: at smaller model sizes (say, under 10B parameters), Qwen utterly dominates downloads, but at the largest scales (100B+), DeepSeek actually holds a larger share of downloads than Qwen. The visualization below illustrates this point. Each curve represents one organization's share of all downloads in a given size tier – and we can see Qwen (red) commanding the small-model segment, while DeepSeek (gold) overtakes in the largest tier:

Share of HuggingFace downloads by model size category (as of end of 2025). Qwen (red curve) dominates the adoption of small and medium models (under 100B). DeepSeek (gold curve) starts with minimal share at small scales but then surpasses Qwen in the 100B+ and especially 250B+ model size tiers.

This dynamic exists because Qwen's publicly available models max out around ~80B, whereas DeepSeek has openly released or otherwise enabled access to models in the 100B–200B+ range (often using Mixture-of-Experts techniques to effectively scale parameters). Moreover, DeepSeek's architecture choices catered to use cases like advanced reasoning and tool integration, which are particularly valued in the largest models for enterprise or research applications. Many U.S.-based AI startups in late 2025 were actually fine-tuning DeepSeek's large models as a starting point for their own custom LLMs. For example, the company Cursor AI built a coding assistant model ("Composer") by fine-tuning a large Chinese model (reportedly a DeepSeek or similar MoE). This indicates that even outside China, the highest-end open models in use often traced back to DeepSeek, not Western releases.

It's also telling that DeepSeek currently beats Qwen in those high-end adoption metrics despite being a smaller organization. This suggests a strategic focus: DeepSeek found a somewhat under-served niche (truly large open models) and became the best at it, whereas Qwen aimed for broad coverage and ubiquity at small/medium scales. Even OpenAI's GPT-OSS, with its 120B model, hasn't yet matched DeepSeek's cumulative presence in the 100B+ segment (though GPT-OSS made substantial inroads in late 2025). In terms of absolute numbers, DeepSeek's models don't rival Qwen's download totals – none of DeepSeek's individual models appear in the top 10 overall downloads. The highest-ranked DeepSeek model on the August'25–Jan'26 list is actually a specialized 8B model (DeepSeek-OCR, an open OCR-focused LLM at #20 with 15.0M downloads), and a distilled 32B variant of R1 at #21 (14.5M). This implies that the largest DeepSeek model checkpoints, while influential, are used by a more select group (likely because fewer people have the resources to download and run 100B+ models). Nonetheless, in relative terms, DeepSeek leads that high-end market segment. For anyone tracking the "open AI race," the takeaway is that Chinese organizations now lead both the breadth of adoption (Qwen for mainstream use) and the frontier of scale (DeepSeek for giant models). Western efforts are playing catch-up on both fronts, with GPT-OSS being the strongest Western response so far.

It's worth mentioning that beyond Qwen and DeepSeek, other new model families have struggled to gain adoption. Google's foray into open models (the Gemma series, e.g. Gemma-3 models at 1B, 4B, 12B, etc.) and Microsoft's open small models (e.g. Phi-3 series) appear in the top 50 list, but at relatively modest rankings (#12 for Google's 1B Gemma with ~20.7M downloads, and #34 for a Microsoft Phi model with ~8M). Likewise, the much-hyped startup Mistral AI (France) made the list with its 7B models – Mistral-7B Instruct v0.2 at #22 (13.3M) and v0.3 at #49 (6.2M) – which is notable but not near Qwen or Llama's scale. These figures reinforce that a handful of organizations capture the bulk of open-model usage. Nathan Lambert observes that models from newcomers like Z.AI, MiniMax, Kimi, Moonshot, etc. "barely show up" in the adoption metrics, being orders of magnitude behind Qwen. In practical terms, this means that while innovation is coming from many directions, the community largely rallies around the proven winners. The open-source LLM ecosystem in 2026 is multipolar, yes – but heavily skewed towards the top 2–3 poles (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) with a couple of secondary ones (DeepSeek, perhaps Mistral/Google) following.

## Key Metrics: Adoption and Performance Benchmarks

To understand the prominence of these model families, it's useful to examine some key performance indicators and metrics that researchers and practitioners track:

- **Download Counts (Adoption Volume):** As discussed, Hugging Face model download counts are a primary metric for community adoption. Qwen models collectively have on the order of hundreds of millions of downloads, outstripping all others. Individual Qwen checkpoints often log tens of millions of pulls within months of release. Llama-based models also have accumulated massive download numbers over the years (Llama 2 and 3 combined downloads likely in the high tens of millions or more, spread across many variants). GPT-OSS, despite being newer, rapidly gained millions of downloads, indicating strong interest especially in the months right after release. It's important to note that a "download" is an imperfect proxy – it could be a single developer grabbing a model once, or an automated script – but in aggregate, these numbers are a telling index of popularity. They reflect not just curiosity but actual integration; models with high download counts are often the ones being repeatedly deployed or fine-tuned by many users.

- **Fine-Tune Derivatives (Ecosystem Engagement):** Another KPI is how many derivative models (fine-tuned or modified versions) stem from a given base model. This indicates the community's engagement and the model's usefulness as a foundation. By the end of 2025, Qwen had the largest share of new fine-tuned models on HuggingFace (filtered for quality) among all bases. Llama was also near the top of this metric, owing to the countless fine-tunes since 2023. Mistral, Google (Gemma), and DeepSeek made up much of the rest of the meaningful fine-tune share. GPT-OSS, being newer, had fewer derivatives by count, but it's expected to grow as more organizations fine-tune the 20B and 120B models for their needs. High derivative counts signal a vibrant ecosystem – for example, if dozens of variants of Qwen3-7B exist (from specialized medical Qwens to role-play chatbots built on Qwen), it means the model is actively being adapted to many tasks. Qwen's lead here aligns with its download lead: people aren't just downloading Qwen, they're building on it. Llama's presence shows its continued role as a base for innovation too. These ecosystem metrics underscore why Qwen and Llama families maintain their top status – they have extensive 3rd-party support that fuels further adoption.

- **Benchmark Performance (Quality Indexes):** In terms of raw capabilities, researchers often cite benchmark aggregates like the Artificial Analysis "Intelligence Index" or Epoch's LLM rankings. Throughout 2025, the consensus was that Chinese open models held the edge in quality. For instance, Moonshot's Kimi K2 1-trillion-parameter model and some Qwen and DeepSeek models vied for the top spots on open-model leaderboards. By late 2025, an open Chinese model (MiniMax's M2) was slightly ahead of OpenAI's GPT-OSS 120B on the Intelligence Index scale. GPT-OSS came close to overtaking it, highlighting how OpenAI closed the gap, but didn't quite surpass the very best Chinese model at that time. These benchmark scores are important KPIs because they influence perception and adoption: many users decide which model to use not only based on availability, but also how "smart" it is as measured by standardized tests (e.g. reasoning puzzles, knowledge quizzes, coding tasks, etc.). The fact that Qwen and its Chinese peers consistently outperform Western open models on benchmarks has helped sustain their adoption lead – users gravitate to models that demonstrate higher accuracy or skill. It's a case of quality driving quantity: the smartest open models attract the most users, which in turn gives them larger communities and more feedback to improve further.

- **Real-World Task Performance:** Beyond academic benchmarks, another crucial KPI is how models perform on practical tasks and KPIs specific to applications. For example, OpenAI reported that GPT-OSS models had strong results on things like few-shot function calling and tool use, even "outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI o1 and GPT-4o on some evaluations". Likewise, DeepSeek's R1 was proven in a real-world setting by powering a production chatbot with a high user satisfaction and engagement (as evidenced by its App Store success). These kind of application-level KPIs – e.g. user adoption of apps, or enterprise metrics like reduced inference cost, latency improvements, etc. – often determine if a model sees wide uptake in industry. Qwen has shined in many of these areas: anecdotal reports suggest Qwen models are used in various Chinese products and even some Western ones because they are "fast, cheap, and good enough" for tasks like content generation and data pipeline automation. A high-profile example: Airbnb's CEO publicly noted in October 2025 that the company was "relying a lot on Alibaba's Qwen model" internally due to its favorable performance/cost profile. Such real-world endorsements serve as powerful validation. The more that credible companies share positive outcomes from using an open model, the more confidence the wider community has in adopting it.

In summary, across these KPIs, Qwen and its Chinese counterparts score top marks – highest downloads, most fine-tune offspring, leading benchmark scores, and successful use-case deployments – explaining why they're at the forefront. Llama continues to hold significant mindshare and usage, reflected in solid (if not top) numbers in each category, largely thanks to its entrenched ecosystem. GPT-OSS, while newer, shows a balanced profile: high quality and growing adoption, which quickly propelled it into the top tier. These metrics not only quantify the state of play but also hint at why things are that way. They illustrate, for example, that openness and performance together create a virtuous cycle of adoption (as seen with Qwen), and that community and compatibility factors can sustain a model's popularity even if its raw performance isn't number one (as seen with Llama).

## Real-World Applications and Visualizations

The impact of these open LLMs can be vividly seen in how they're being applied in the real world. To complement the quantitative view, here we highlight a few concrete examples and visual trends:

- **Enterprise Adoption Patterns:** The open-source nature of these models means companies large and small are experimenting with them for various needs. We've already mentioned Airbnb's use of Qwen. Another trend is enterprises balancing performance vs. compliance – some Western firms prefer Western-developed models (like GPT-OSS or Google's Gemma) for legal and branding comfort, even if Qwen is technically superior. In fact, one enterprise AI provider noted that among its Fortune 500 clients, Google's Gemma models and Mistral were currently more commonly used than Qwen, simply due to trust and integration reasons. This shows that "most-used" overall doesn't always mean "most-used in every sector." Still, even Western enterprises are gradually warming to Qwen and DeepSeek as those prove their worth; forward-thinking companies are starting to adopt Qwen due to its efficiency. We can visualize the enterprise landscape as a shifting pie chart – historically dominated by Llama and proprietary models, now slowly giving slices to Qwen and GPT-OSS. The key point is that open models are moving from research labs into real products and services. OpenAI's collaboration with Snowflake on GPT-OSS for secure data handling is one example, and Microsoft's inclusion of Llama and others in its Azure offerings (via the Azure ML Model Catalog) is another. These illustrate how the open models are not just academically interesting, but economically and operationally relevant.

- **Multimodal and Specialized Use-Cases:** The top-50 model list reveals that people are downloading not only pure text models, but also multimodal models (text+vision) and domain-specific models in large numbers. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (a vision-language model) ranks #10 with 23.3M downloads, and Llava-1.5-7B (another vision-augmented LLM) appears at #38. This indicates a real demand for open models that can interpret images or perform visual question-answering, likely spurred by applications in robotics, accessibility (e.g. image captioning for the visually impaired), and multi-modal assistants. Another example is DeepSeek-OCR (#20), explicitly fine-tuned for optical character recognition tasks – a sign that open LLMs are being tailored for niche but important tasks like reading scanned documents or images. We also see Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B (an instruction-tuned coding assistant model) in the rankings, reflecting the continued interest in code-generation models for developers. These specialized models serve as KPIs for diversity of usage: not everyone is just building chatbots; some are leveraging open LLMs for vision, for code, for specific industries (medical, legal, etc. via fine-tunes). The breadth of top models used in 2025/26 showcases how the open model ecosystem is maturing to cover a variety of functions. In a blog context, one could visualize this with a bar chart of the top models grouped by category (general instruct vs multimodal vs code vs others), showing that while general models get the highest counts, multimodal and specialized ones hold significant share too.

- **Community and Innovation Visualization:** Another way to visualize the open LLM boom is via the growth of model hubs and repositories over time. The ATOM project data tracked over 1,152 significant open models released after ChatGPT's debut. A timeline plot of cumulative releases or downloads can be illuminating. For example, one of Lambert's charts (not shown here) illustrated that as of January 2026, total downloads of tracked open models were approaching 1 billion, with an inflection point ("The Flip") where Chinese contributions accelerated past Western ones in mid-2025. This kind of chart (like the earlier Models Worldwide graph) provides a macro perspective: it visualizes how quickly the open model ecosystem exploded in 2024–25 (a near-exponential curve), and how China's share (red line) went from a slow start to the steepest climb. For a blog reader, such visuals reinforce the narrative quantitatively: they show, in a glance, that something dramatic changed in 2025 in the open AI world. The proliferation of new model names on the x-axis and the steep rise of the cumulative downloads underscore that we are in an era of rapid, democratized AI development, with Qwen and its peers at the forefront.

- **Safety and Compliance Considerations:** A subtle but important real-world aspect is how these open models handle safety, and how that affects adoption. While not a KPI in the traditional sense, features like robust content filtering, or compliance with privacy norms, can determine if an enterprise will use a model. OpenAI emphasized safety evaluations in its GPT-OSS release – they adversarially tested GPT-OSS-120B and reported it meets similar safety standards as their closed models. Chinese model providers have been a bit less transparent publicly about safety, leading to some caution among Western adopters who wonder about hidden risks. A Deep discussion might include a brief note on this: for example, the fact that many companies still refrain from using Qwen/DeepSeek because they cannot be sure about possible backdoors or training data issues (a concern Lambert mentioned in May 2025). Visualizing this is tricky, but one could imagine a comparative table of model families vs. known compliance certifications or safety benchmarks. For now, suffice it to say that perceived safety is an emerging metric that open models will need to contend with, and it might shape the next phase of adoption (e.g. Western open models might gain ground if they're seen as more transparent or aligned with regulatory requirements).

In all these real-world dimensions, the leading open LLM families are making their mark. Qwen is being embedded into consumer apps and enterprise workflows, Llama remains a workhorse for countless projects, GPT-OSS is finding a niche in organizations that require open solutions with top-tier quality, and DeepSeek is enabling cutting-edge research and specialized applications. The visual evidence – from charts of download surges to examples of apps – confirms the story: the open-source AI revolution is here, and it's being led by a mix of familiar names and new powerhouses.

## Conclusion

The state of open-language models in 2026 reveals an ecosystem both transformed and revealingly stubborn. On one hand, Chinese models like Qwen have decisively taken the crown in usage, reflecting a power shift in AI innovation toward China. Qwen's dominance in downloads and community adoption, paired with DeepSeek's surprising leadership in the largest-scale models, underscores that the frontier of open AI is no longer an American or Western stronghold. This is backed by the fact that Chinese open models also top most quality benchmarks, offering the best "bang for the buck" in many settings. It seems that dethroning Qwen in terms of adoption "looks impossible" in the short term – the momentum it has gained will carry forward into 2026 and beyond. Western efforts like GPT-OSS, while extremely promising in capability, currently play second fiddle in terms of sheer usage (even if they punch above their weight in sophistication). The data tells a clear story: Qwen, Llama, and GPT-OSS are the trio defining open models today, with DeepSeek as a crucial fourth for special cases. Any new entrant hoping to join their ranks faces an uphill battle to accumulate comparable community and industry support.

On the other hand, the enduring popularity of Llama shows that the open-source community values stability and familiarity. Ecosystem effects – libraries, fine-tunes, user knowledge – mean that the AI world doesn't instantly discard an older model just because a new champion emerges. This inertia is not mere resistance to change; it's a sign of maturation. Just as Linux distributions or other open-source infrastructure often persist widely even after newer alternatives come out, Llama's continued prominence highlights the importance of trust and continuity in an open ecosystem. The "Llama vs. Qwen" dynamic also reflects a broader point about open innovation: once knowledge (model weights, in this case) is released, it can become a permanent part of the collective toolkit, improved and repurposed indefinitely. Meta's Llama gift to the world ensured that open LLM development had a sturdy foundation – something that Qwen built upon and extended, rather than simply replaced overnight.

Looking ahead, one can anticipate a few developments. Competition will intensify as more players (from big tech companies to startups) release new models – but as 2025 showed, quality and community adoption are what separate signal from noise. The U.S. and other Western teams will strive to narrow the gap with Chinese models; OpenAI's GPT-OSS and emerging efforts like Nvidia's "Nemotron" or Google's next-gen open models (Gemini's potential open offshoots, perhaps codenamed Gemma) will be key to watch. Meanwhile, Alibaba and others in China are not standing still – a Qwen 4 is likely on the horizon, and if history is any guide, it will push performance even further while trying to maintain the user base lead. There's also growing interest in specialization: smaller models tailored to specific domains might carve out their own top spots (we already see hints of this with specialized models like DeepSeek-OCR and Qwen-VL ranking highly). And as multimodality and tool-use become standard requirements, open models that excel in those dimensions will rise.

Finally, the open model ecosystem's evolution is not just a tech story but a geopolitical and economic one. The Chinese dominance in open AI raises questions for Western policymakers and businesses – should there be a concerted effort to invest in open models domestically to ensure AI competitiveness and security? The open-source community may become an arena for international collaboration or competition, depending on how stakeholders behave. But regardless of origin, one thing is clear: open models are now a permanent, critical part of the AI landscape. They have empowered a worldwide community of developers and given enterprises new options beyond closed APIs. The period from 2023 to 2026 has been about proving that open LLMs can reach cutting-edge performance and massive adoption. As of 2026, that proof is delivered – from Qwen's sweeping usage to GPT-OSS's high-grade open performance, we have witnessed a revolution in how AI progress is shared. The task ahead is to continue this trajectory responsibly, ensuring that as these top models become ubiquitous, they are used to benefit as many people as possible while mitigating risks. In sum, the top open LLMs of 2026 not only tell a story of technical achievement and widespread uptake, but also reflect the values and challenges of a rapidly democratizing AI world.
