excerpt: This year's game was a snooze at home—but it got me thinking about last year in Philly, when the city went crazy.

Bro, this year's Super Bowl was actually so boring I went to sleep after halftime. I can't lie though—being at home and watching it felt totally different from last year.

When I was in college I lived in Philly with my best friends. We had people over, went down to Center City, and everyone was going crazy. That energy—the city coming alive, friends everywhere—hit different. This time around it was just me and the screen. Same game, totally different vibe.
