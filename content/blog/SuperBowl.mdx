excerpt: Same game. Two cities. Completely different feelings.

I fell asleep sometime around halftime. That kind of tells you how this year’s Super Bowl went.

Watching it at home was fine. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Just the game on in the background.

It did make me think about last year though.

When the Eagles were doing well, being in Philly felt different. I was at Temple, living with my best friends, and it felt like everyone was following the same thing at the same time. People coming over, TVs on, constant noise.

Going into Center City during that stretch was chaotic. Packed bars, traffic, people celebrating with strangers. Philly actually felt connected for once.

This year was the opposite. Just me and my family. Same game, quieter setting.

And honestly, I didn’t mind it.

I don’t miss being in the middle of everything this time. But I’m glad I got to experience it when I did.
