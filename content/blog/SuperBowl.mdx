excerpt: Same game. Two cities. Completely different feelings.
---

Halftime hit.  
I fell asleep.

That kind of Super Bowl.

No yelling.  
No pacing.  

Made me think.

Philly.

The Eagles were rolling  
and so was the city.  
Everything felt louder
streets, bars, living rooms, hearts.

Back at Temple,  
rooming with my best friends,  
it felt like the walls disappeared.  
People everywhere.  
Energy spilling into Center City.

Philly was alive.  
Chaos.

Football wasn’t just football.  
It was belonging.

This year though—  
just me and my family.  
Same game.  
Different weight.

No crowds.  
No noise.  
Just comfort.

And I didn’t hate it.

Two Super Bowls.  
Two versions of me.  
One loud and unforgettable.  
One quiet and grounding.

I don’t miss Philly tonight.  
But I’m grateful  
I was there when it mattered.
